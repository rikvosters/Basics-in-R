I saw it sodder'd up, and the Body of his Son was then within it. 
And afterwards I attended the Funeral, and saw the same Coffin put into Bow Church Vault in February 1721.
Last Monday Sev'n-night, between Four and Five in the Morning, the Prisoner came to me with this Mallet and Chissel, and we went together into Bow Church Vault, and there he cut the Lead and Plate off of Mr. Boyville's Son's Coffin. 
I knew it to be his Coffin, because there was an Inscription upon it. 
I help'd him to carry the Lead to Mr. Moore in King-street, in Old-Street-Square, who gave us at the Rate of 9 s. 4 d. a Hundred for it. 
The Prisoner was under Grave-Digger of Aldgate, and I am sometimes 'employ'd as a Bearer, by Mr. Robinson, the Sexton, of Bow Church. 
The Prisoner got the Key of the Vault of Mr. Robinson's Maid Mary, who will let him have it at any time, because he gives her now and then a Penny, or two Pence.
