### 6. DATA EXPLORATION AND VISUALIZATION -----


### 6.1 Preparation -----

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(writexl)

# empty workspace
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))

# For this section, we'll work with a slightly modified version of the well-known Titanic dataset (source: 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster' - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/), which is often used in machine learning. 

tt <- read.csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rikvosters/Basics-in-R/master/Titanic_training.csv", na.strings = "")
tt <- as_tibble(tt)

# It contains data on survived (Survived = 1) and deceased (Survived = 0) passengers, and their characteristics (i.e. ID, name, passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings and spouses on board, number of parents and children on board, the price of their fare, and the port where they embarked)
tt

# Let's rename the untransparent letters of the port where they embarked
tt$Embarked <- fct_recode(tt$Embarked, "Cherbourg (FR)" = "C", "Queenstown (IR)" = "Q", "Southampton (EN)" = "S")
tt

# Have a first look at the dataset
tt

# Oops, we forgot to make Survived and Class into factors
class(tt$Survived)

tt$Survived <- as.factor(tt$Survived)
tt$Class <- as.factor(tt$Class)

# Check order of factor levels
levels(tt$Embarked)
levels(tt$Class)
levels(tt$Survived) # all okay for now

# Better!
tt
str(tt)
summary(tt)

# A first visual view

# easier with tapply
tapply(tt$Fare, tt$Embarked, mean)

# round?
round(prop.table(table(tt$Survived, tt$Sex), 2), 2)

# percentages?
round(prop.table(table(dv, iv), 2), 3)*100

# tip: make your own function

### 6.4 Numerically summarizing - tidyverse/dplyr -----

# two new tidyverse/dplyr operators: group_by() and summarise()

# make new tibble with summarize
tt %>% 
  summarise(mean_fare = mean(Fare))

# use group_by to introduce grouping independent variables
tt %>% 
  group_by(Embarked) %>% 
  summarise(mean_fare = mean(Fare))

# you can add various summary functions
tt %>% 
  group_by(Embarked) %>% 
  summarise(mean_fare = mean(Fare),
            stddev_fare = sd(Fare),
            median_fare = median(Fare),
            IQR_fare = IQR(Fare)) -> summ_embarked
summ_embarked

# combine with other dplyr functions, such as filter to filter out NA's
tt %>% 
  filter(is.na(Embarked) == FALSE) %>%
  group_by(Embarked) %>% 
  summarise(mean_fare = mean(Fare))

# or filter to select only certain ages
tt %>% 
  filter(Age >= 18) %>% 
  group_by(Embarked) %>% 
  summarise(mean_fare = mean(Fare))

# you can also introduce several grouping independent variables
tt %>% 
  group_by(Embarked, Sex) %>% 
  summarise(mean_fare = mean(Fare))

# useful function to use with summarise: n() = number of rows
tt %>%

  summarise(mean_fare = mean(Fare),
            number_passengers = n()) %>%

####--- | exercise: influenza ---####

# Load a collection on US age-adjusted death rates for selected major causes of death per 100,000 U.S. inhabitants (1900-2013) (source: https://data.world/health/death-rates-for-major-causes), located online ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rikvosters/Basics-in-R/master/DeathRatesforMajorCauses_wide.csv"). Transform it from its current (very) wide format to a long data format. Then, filter out the death rates per year for 'Influenza and Pneumonia', and make an appropriate plot of this using ggplot. 

####--- | exercise: flights ---####

# Install and load the 'flights' package, and then assign the element 'hflights' to a new dataframe of your choice. Also convert it into a tibble, and then select the variables Year, DayOfWeek, DepTime, UniqueCarrier, AirTime, ArrDelay, Dest, Distance, Cancelled, and CancellationCode, removing the others. Now, try to explore yoru data to answer the following questions:
# Which percentage of flights was cancelled in 2011? Visualize in a barplot.
# Calculate the percentage of flights cancelled versus the percentage of flights not cancelled, and visualize this in a simple barplot.
# Recode CancellationCode ("carrier" = "A", "weather" = "B", "FFA" = "C", "security" = "D") and use it to find out what the major cause of flight cancellations is.
# Plot the distance versus the arrival delay for all short-haul flights (i.e. with a total distance under 500 miles).
# Try to find out what the total airtime is per weekday, for the AA (American Airlines) and EV (ExpressJet) carriers. Plot this in a barplot with a different facet for each of the two carriers.
# Make a boxplot and a violin plot of the arrival delay for airline companies AA (American Airlines), DL (Delta) and US (US Airways), so you can check out which of these three companies holds the record in terms of arrival delay.


### 7. BASIC STATISTICS -----

# Based on Gries' 2013 - Statistics for Linguistics with R


### 7.1 Distributions -----

# Shapiro Wilk Test: check for normal distribution

# Fare
shapiro.test(tt$Fare) # if p < 0.05, then significantly different from normal distribution (so: NOT normally distributed)
hist(tt$Fare)

# Age 
shapiro.test(tt$Age)
library(rcompanion)
plotNormalHistogram(tt$Age)

# Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
# alternative: for large datasets and for dependent variable + independent variable
ks.test(tt$Fare, "pnorm", mean=mean(tt$Fare), sd=sd(tt$Fare))
ks.test(tt$Age[tt$Sex == "male"], tt$Age[tt$Sex == "female"]) # p > 0.05, thus not sign. different 
                                                              # in terms of distribution 
                                                              # (D = 0.1038, p-value = 0.056)

### 7.2 Frequencies -----

# Categorical variables

# Chi-squared test 

# 1 variable: are the two outcomes of Survived equally frequent?

table(tt$Survived)

# statistical test  (! always assign a test to a separate element, e.g. "test")
test <- chisq.test(table(tt$Survived)) 
test # sign.

# assumptions
# - all observations are independent of each other
# - 80% of expected frequencies >= 5, and all >1
str(test)
test$expected
test$p.value

# Conclusion: the two outcomes (survived, deceased) are not equally frequent (chi-square=48.091, df=1, p<0.001)

# note: never run chi-square test (or other significance test) on relative frequencies! (sensitive to sample size, which != 100)

# 2 variables: is there a correlation between two variables?

# numerically
table(tt$Survived, tt$Embarked)

# visually
library(vcd)
assoc(table(tt$Survived, tt$Embarked), shade=TRUE, legend = T) # blue = more observations than expected under null hypothesis; red = less observations

# statistically
test <- chisq.test(table(tt$Survived, tt$Embarked))
test
test$residuals # notice large deviation from 0 for Cherbourg ~ Surviving

# assumptions
test$expected

  # if not: Fisher's exact test, often used for small samples
  fisher.test(table(tt$Survived, tt$Embarked))

# also: Cramer's V to show strength of association (= effect size) 
library(DescTools)
CramerV(table(tt$Survived, tt$Embarked)) # report Cramer's V: from 0 to 1 (= perfect association)
# compare:
CramerV(table(tt$Survived, tt$Class))


### 7.3 Means -----

# numeric dependent variable, categorical independent variable
# 2 variables: do differences in ticket fare differ significantly by gender (i.e. between men and women)?

# Welch Two Sample t-test
t.test(tt$Fare ~ tt$Sex) 

# assumption of independent samples - otherwise (e.g. repeated-measures design), use paired versions

# assumption of normality
tapply(tt$Fare, tt$Sex, shapiro.test) # violates assumption of normality!

# Wilcoxon rank sum test (U-test)
wilcox.test(tt$Fare ~ tt$Sex) # for ordinal data
tapply(tt$Fare, tt$Sex, median) # so median difference is significant


### 7.4 Correlations -----

# 2 numeric variables: can we predict Fare if we know Age?

# visually
plot(tt$Fare ~ tt$Age)
abline(lm(Fare ~ Age, data=tt), col="red", lwd=2) # alt for geom_smooth

# correlation score:
cor(tt$Fare, tt$Age, use = "complete.obs") # ignore NA's: use = "complete.obs"s
                                           # very slight positive correlation

# assumption of normality
shapiro.test(tt$Age); shapiro.test(tt$Fare) # if p < 0.05, then NOT normally distributed

####--- | exercise: metal fan base ---#####

# Use 'read_excel' to load the 'metal_data.xlsx' dataframe from the working directory on your computer, and do the same to also load the 'metal_meta.xlsx' metadata file (source: https://www.kaggle.com/mrpantherson/metal-by-nation). Merge both using the merge() function, using the ID column as a unique identifier. Then explore the new dataset, and answer two questions:
# 1. Is there a correlation between the year a band was formed and its number of fans? Explore visually and test statistically.
# 2. Lump all of the countries of origin together into the two most frequent countries + one 'other' category. Then look if you can detect any differences in mean or median fan base between two most common countries. Explore numerically and graphically, and also do appropriate statistical testing.

####--- | exercise: female chess players ---#####

# Load a dataframe (source: https://www.kaggle.com/vikasojha98/top-women-chess-players) with recent scores by female chess players. Read it as csv and convert it to a tibble, but remove the variables 'Inactive_flag' and 'Gender'. Then, split the variable 'Age' up into 3 predefined groups (young = under 30, middle = 30-60, older = 60+), and split variable 'Standard_Rating' into 3 groups ("low", "medium", "high" -- allowing R to determine the exact cut-off points itself). Next, check out a possible effect of the (now) ordinal variable 'Age' on the ordinal variable 'Rating' -- explore numerically, graphically, and statistically. Finally, convert the dataset from a wide to a long format, and plot year of birth and rating (but only for the 'Blitz_rating' type), for both Russian (RUS) and Polish (POL) players in different colors, and add a LOESS smoother (method = "loess") for each group.
